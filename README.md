<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The findings of the job market analysis for data analysts yielded significant insights regarding the prevailing skills and companies actively recruiting. The key proficiencies in demand were SQL, Tableau, and Python. Based on the dataset, the primary hiring locations comprised remote positions in the United States. However, it is worth noting that these figures may not accurately represent the actual hiring locations due to the inclusion of ambiguous entries such as 'Anywhere' and 'United States'. The results of the regression model revealed a negative R-squared value, suggesting inadequate performance and a poor fit for the available data.</p>
